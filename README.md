Intro to HTML and CSS
=====================

We will be using Glitch.com to create our web portfolios as it will allow us to preview our work in realtime time and collaborate quickly.

Click `Show` in the header to see your app live. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

**Glitch** is the friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. Glitch lets you instantly create, remix, edit, and host an app, bot or site, and you can invite collaborators or helpers to simultaneously edit code with you.

This Example
------------

### ← README.md

That's this file, it acts as a guide to the project.

### ← index.html

This is the main document that is displayed when you use 'Show' up top. 

### ← index(nocomments).html

This is identical to index.html but I have removed the comments to provide an alternate view.

### ← style.css

This is our style sheet, it is equivlent to the story style sheet in Twine.

This is an example script written with JavaScript. 
Some scripts will be housed with your other files and some will be linked from other sites.
